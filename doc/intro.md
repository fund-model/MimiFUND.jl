The Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and
Distribution (FUND) is a so-called integrated assessment model of
climate change. FUND was originally set-up to study the role of
international capital transfers in climate policy, but it soon
evolved into a test-bed for studying impacts of climate change in a
dynamic context, and it is now often used to perform cost-benefit
and cost-effectiveness analyses of greenhouse gas emission reduction
policies, to study equity of climate change and climate policy, and
to support game-theoretic investigations into international
environmental agreements.

FUND links scenarios and simple models of population, technology,
economics, emissions, atmospheric chemistry, climate, sea level, and
impacts. Together, these elements describe not-implausible futures.
The model runs in time-steps of one year from 1950 to 2300, and
distinguishes 16 major world regions.

FUND further includes the option to reduce emissions of industrial
carbon dioxide. Reductions can be set by the user, or calculated so
as to meet certain criteria set by the user.

An integrated assessment model, FUND is used to advice policymakers
about proper and not-so-proper strategies. The model, however, always
reflects its developer's world views. It is therefore regularly
contrary to the rhetoric of politicians, and occasionally politically
incorrect.

It is the developer's firm belief that most researchers should be
locked away in an ivory tower. Models are often quite useless in
unexperienced hands, and sometimes misleading. No one is smart
enough to master in a short period what took someone else years to
develop. Not-understood models are irrelevant, half-understood
models treacherous, and mis-understood models dangerous.

Therefore, FUND does not have a pretty interface, and you will have
to make to real effort to let it do something, let alone to let it
do something new. You can run FUND with the free Visual C# Express
Edition.

FUND was originally developed by Richard Tol. It is now co-developed
by David Anthoff and Richard Tol. FUND does not have an institutional
home.
