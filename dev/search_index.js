The calibration is such that a 10% emission reduction cut in 2003 would cost 1.57% (1.38%) of GDP of the least (most) carbon-intensive region; this is calibrated to Hourcade et al. (1996, 2001). An 80% (85%) emission reduction would completely ruin the economy. Later emission reductions are cheaper by Equations (CO2.7) and (CO2.8). Emission reduction is relatively cheap for regions with high emission intensities. The thought is that emission reduction is cheap in countries that use a lot of energy and rely heavily on fossil fuels, while other countries use less energy and less fossil fuels and are therefore closer to the technological frontier of emission abatement. For relatively small emission reduction, the costs in FUND correspond closely to those reported by other top-down models, but for higher emission reduction, FUND finds higher costs, because FUND does not include backstop technologies, that is, a carbon-free energy supply that is available in unlimited quantities at fixed average costs.","category":"page"},{"location":"science/#","page":"Science","title":"Science","text":"The regional and global knowledge stocks follow from","category":"page"},{"location":"science/#","page":"Science","title":"Science","text":"H_tr = H_t - 1rsqrt1 + gamma_Rtau_t - 1r tagCO29","category":"page"},{"location":"science/#","page":"Science","title":"Science","text":"and","category":"page"},{"location":"science/#","page":"Science","title":"Science","text":"H_t^G = H_t - 1^Gsqrt1 + gamma_Gtau_tr tagCO210","category":"page"},{"location":"science/#","page":"Science","title":"Science","text":"Knowledge accumulates with emission abatement.
