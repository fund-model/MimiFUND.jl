The carbon intensity of energy use, and the energy intensity of production follow from:</p><div>\[\psi_{t,r} = g_{t - 1,r}^{\psi}\psi_{t - 1,r} - \alpha_{t - 1,r}\tau_{t - 1,r} \tag{CO2.2}\]</div><p>and</p><div>\[\varphi_{t,r} = g_{t - 1,r}^{\varphi}\varphi_{t - 1,r} - \alpha_{t - 1,r}\tau_{t - 1,r} \tag{CO2.3}\]</div><p>where <span>$\tau$</span> is policy intervention and <span>$\alpha$</span> is a parameter. The exogenous growth rates <span>$g$</span> are referred to as the Autonomous Energy Efficiency Improvement (AEEI) and the Autonomous Carbon Efficiency Improvement (ACEI). See Tables AEEI and ACEI for the five alternative scenarios (values for the years 2301-3000 again equal the values for the year 2300). Policy also affects emissions via</p><div>\[M_{t,r} = \left( \psi_{t,r} - \chi_{t,r}^{\psi} \right)\left( \varphi_{t,r} - \chi_{t,r}^{\varphi} \right)Y_{t,r} \tag{CO2.1}\]</div><div>\[\chi_{t,r}^{\psi} = \kappa_{\psi}\chi_{t - 1,r} + \left( 1 - \alpha_{t - 1,r} \right)\tau_{t - 1,r}^{\psi} \tag{CO2.4}\]</div><p>and</p><div>\[\chi_{t,r}^{\varphi} = \kappa_{\varphi}\chi_{t - 1,r} + \left( 1 - \alpha_{t - 1,r} \right)\tau_{t - 1,r}^{\varphi} \tag{CO2.5}\]</div><p>Thus, the variable <span>$0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$</span> governs which part of emission reduction is <em>permanent</em> (reducing carbon and energy intensities at all future times) and which part of emission reduction is <em>temporary</em> (reducing current energy consumptions and carbon emissions), fading at a rate of <span>$0 &lt; \kappa &lt; 1$</span>. In the base case, <span>$\kappa_{\psi} = \kappa_{\varphi} = 0.9$</span> and</p><div>\[\alpha_{t,r} = 1 - \frac{\tau_{t,r}/100}{1 + \tau_{t,r}/100} \tag{CO2.6}\]</div><p>So that <span>$\alpha = 0.5$</span> if <span>$\tau = \$100/\text{tC}$</span>. One may interpret the difference between permanent and temporary emission reduction as affecting commercial technologies and capital stocks, respectively. The emission reduction module is a reduced form way of modelling that part of the emission reduction fades away after the policy intervention is reversed, but that another part remains through technological lock-in. Learning effects are described below. The parameters of the model are chosen so that <em>FUND</em> roughly resembles the behaviour of other models, particularly those of the Energy Modeling Forum (Weyant, 2004; Weyant <em>et al.</em>, 2006).</p><p>The costs of emission reduction <span>$C$</span> are given by</p><div>\[\frac{C_{t,r}}{Y_{t,r}} = \frac{\beta_{t,r}\tau_{t,r}^{2}}{H_{t,r}H_{t}^{g}} \tag{CO2.7}\]</div><p><span>$H$</span> denotes the stock of knowledge. Equation (CO2.6) gives the costs of emission reduction in a particular year for emission reduction in that year. In combination with Equations (CO2.2)-(CO2.5), emission reduction is cheaper if smeared out over a longer time period. The parameter <span>$\beta$</span> follows from</p><div>\[\beta_{t,r} = 0.784 - 0.084\sqrt{\frac{M_{t,r}}{Y_{t,r}} - \operatorname{}\frac{M_{t,s}}{Y_{t,s}}} \tag{CO2.8}\]</div><p>That is, emission reduction is relatively expensive for the region that has the lowest emission intensity. The calibration is such that a 10% emission reduction cut in 2003 would cost 1.57% (1.38%) of GDP of the least (most) carbon-intensive region; this is calibrated to Hourcade <em>et al.</em> (1996, 2001). An 80% (85%) emission reduction would completely ruin the economy. Later emission reductions are cheaper by Equations (CO2.7) and (CO2.8). Emission reduction is relatively cheap for regions with high emission intensities. The thought is that emission reduction is cheap in countries that use a lot of energy and rely heavily on fossil fuels, while other countries use less energy and less fossil fuels and are therefore closer to the technological frontier of emission abatement. For relatively small emission reduction, the costs in <em>FUND</em> correspond closely to those reported by other top-down models, but for higher emission reduction, <em>FUND</em> finds higher costs, because <em>FUND</em> does not include backstop technologies, that is, a carbon-free energy supply that is available in unlimited quantities at fixed average costs.</p><p>The regional and global knowledge stocks follow from</p><div>\[H_{t,r} = H_{t - 1,r}\sqrt{1 + \gamma_{R}\tau_{t - 1,r}} \tag{CO2.9}\]</div><p>and</p><div>\[H_{t}^{G} = H_{t - 1}^{G}\sqrt{1 + \gamma_{G}\tau_{t,r}} \tag{CO2.10}\]</div><p>Knowledge accumulates with emission abatement. More knowledge implies lower emission reduction costs. The parameters <span>$\gamma$</span> determine which part of the knowledge is kept within the region, and which part spills over to other regions as well. In the base case, <span>$\gamma_{R} = 0.9$</span> and <span>$\gamma_{G} = 0.1$</span>. The model is similar in structure and numbers to that of Goulder and Schneider (1999) and Goulder and Mathai (2000).</p><p>Emissions from land use change and deforestation are exogenous, and cannot be mitigated.

They are averaged over the studies and the climate scenarios for each country, and aggregated to the <em>FUND</em> regions.

Human health: Cardiovascular and respiratory mortality</a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#.9.-Human-health:-Cardiovascular-and-respiratory-mortality-1" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Cardiovascular and respiratory disorders are worsened by both extreme cold and extreme hot weather. Martens (1998) assesses the increase in mortality for 17 countries. Tol (2002a) extrapolates these findings to all other countries, based on formulae of the shape:</p><div>\[D^{c} = \alpha^{c} + \beta^{c}T_{B} \tag{HC.1}\]</div><p>where</p><ul><li><span>$D^{c}$</span> denotes the change in mortality (in deaths per 100,000 people) due to a one degree global warming;</li><li><span>$c$</span> indexes the disease (heat-related cardiovascular under 65, heat-related cardiovascular over 65, cold-related cardiovascular under 65, cold-related cardiovascular over 65, respiratory);</li><li><span>$T_{B}$</span> is the current temperature of the hottest or coldest month in the country (in degree Celsius);</li><li><span>$\alpha$</span> and <span>$\beta$</span> are parameters, specified in Table HC.1.</li></ul><p>Equation (HC.1) is specified for populations above and below 65 years of age for cardiovascular disorders. Cardiovascular mortality is affected by both heat and cold. In the case of heat, <span>$T_{B}$</span> denotes the average temperature of the warmest month. In the case of cold, <span>$T_{B}$</span> denotes the average temperature of the coldest month. Respiratory mortality is not age-specific.</p><p>Equation (HC.1) is readily extrapolated. With warming, the baseline temperature <span>$T_{B}$</span> changes. If this change is proportional to the change in the global mean temperature, the equation becomes quadratic. Summing country-specific quadratic functions results in quadratic functions for the regions:</p><div>\[D_{t,r}^{c} = \alpha_{r}^{c}T_{t} + \beta_{r}^{c}T_{t}^{2} \tag{HC.2}\]</div><p>where</p><ul><li><span>$D_{t,r}^{c}$</span> denotes climate-change-induced mortality (in deaths per 100,000 people) due to disease <span>$c$</span> in region <span>$r$</span> at time <span>$t$</span>;</li><li><span>$c$</span> indexes the disease (heat-related cardiovascular under 65, heat-related cardiovascular over 65, cold-related cardiovascular under 65, cold-related cardiovascular over 65, respiratory);</li><li><span>$r$</span> indexes region;</li><li><span>$t$</span> indexes time;</li><li><span>$T_{t}$</span> denotes the mean temperature in year <span>$t$</span>, in degrees Celcius (C);</li><li><span>$\alpha$</span> and <span>$\beta$</span> are parameters, specified in Tables HC.2-4 (in probabilistic mode all probablitiy distributions are constrained so that only values with the same sign as the mean can be sampled).</li></ul><p>One problem with (HC.2) is that it is a non-linear extrapolation based on a data-set that is limited to 17 countries and, more importantly, a single climate change scenario. A global warming of 1°C leads to changes in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in the order of magnitude of 1% of baseline mortality due to such disorders. Per cause, the total change in mortality is restricted to a maximum of 5% of baseline mortality, an expert guess. This restriction is binding. Baseline cardiovascular and respiratory mortality derives from the share of the population above 65 in the total population.</p><p>If the fraction of people over 65 increases by 1%, cardiovascular mortality increases by 0.0259% (0.0096%). For respiratory mortality, the change is 0.0016% (0.0005%). These parameters are estimated from the variation in population above 65 and cardiovascular and respiratory mortality over the nine regions in 1990, using data from http://www.who.int/health_topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/.</p><p>Mortality as in equations (HC.1) and (HC.2) is expressed as a fraction of population size. Cardiovascular mortality, however, is separately specified for younger and older people. In 1990, the per capita income elasticity of the share of the population over 65 is 0.25 (0.08). This is estimated using data from http://earthtrends.wri.org</p><p>Heat-related mortality is assumed to be limited to urban populations.
